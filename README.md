# 30nama
hey guys,
I wrote some script in [Python](https://www.python.org/) for first time.
these scripts can scrap 30nama website which is a website for movies, series, anime etc.
its address **changes** all the time and you have to find it somehow.
here is a [link ](https://30nama.pw/dl/URLFinder[30nama][Win].zip) of its app which helps you to find website address.
>you have to change url in the codes whenever you want to scrapt by yourself.
